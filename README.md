 ## Backend Only

 If you are focused on backend; submit the backend part of any of the above challenges.

 > Currently we are not hiring purely frontend engineers.


You have to build this project from scratch i.e. a big chunk of the code cannot come from a similar open source project. 

You may use any web framework based on either Java, Kotlin, or Typescript. Bonus points if you use any of the AWS infrastructure and services like SQS, SNS, Lambda, AWS SAM.

Front-end technologies like React, Vue, and TypeScript get you ahead in the queue.

If you are using React use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as a starting 
point.

## *** What are we looking for? ***
1. How creative is your solution?
2. Commit history to see how your work evolved
3. Code quality and best practices
4. Documentation
5. Functionality

These challenges will NOT self-destruct in the next 5 seconds and will be available for you when you are ready. Submit one
and start your interview process with us.

Good luck.
